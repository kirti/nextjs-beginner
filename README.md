How to setup next js basic Structure - beginner guide 


# Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
 Server-Side Rendering is a technique used in Next.js where the initial HTML of a page is generated on the server and then sent to the client. This helps improve SEO, and initial page load performance, and provides a better user experience.
# Static Site Generation (SSG): 
Static Site Generation is a feature in Next.js that generates HTML for all possible routes at build time. This approach is suitable for content-driven websites and blogs where the content doesn't change frequently.

# Client-Side Rendering (CSR): 
Client-Side Rendering is the traditional approach where the initial HTML is loaded, and then JavaScript takes over to render and manage the UI on the client side. This can be less SEO-friendly compared to SSR.

# Data Fetching: 
Next.js provides various methods to fetch data for pages, including getStaticProps (for SSG), getServerSideProps (for SSR), and useSWR (a data fetching hook). These methods help you fetch and pre-render data before sending it to the client.

# Pages and Routing: 
In Next.js, each file in the pages directory corresponds to a route. For example, pages/index.js corresponds to the root route ("/"). You can use file-based routing to create different pages for your application.

# Link Component: 
The Link component from the next/link module is used to create client-side navigation between pages. It prefetches pages in the background, improving user experience.

# Dynamic Routing: 
Next.js supports dynamic routing, allowing you to create routes with parameters. For example, you can create a dynamic route like /posts/[id], where [id] is a parameter.

# API Routes: 
The pages/api directory in Next.js allows you to create serverless API routes. These routes can handle HTTP requests and server-side logic.

# Layout Component: 
A Layout component is often used to provide a consistent structure and styling across multiple pages. It wraps around the content of individual pages.

# Head Component: 
The Head component from the next/head the module is used to modify the HTML head section of pages. You can set metadata, titles, and more using this component.

# CSS Modules: 
CSS Modules allow you to scope styles to specific components by generating unique class names. This helps avoid global style conflicts.

# Error Handling: 
Next.js provides an ErrorBoundary component to catch and handle errors in your application. It's used to display a fallback UI when an error occurs during rendering.

# Image Component: 
The Image component from the next/image module optimizes images for performance by providing features like lazy loading and automatic resizing.

# Environment Variables: 
You can use environment variables in your Next.js application by using the process.env object. These variables are defined in a .env.local file.

# Deployment: 
Next.js applications can be deployed to various hosting platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and more. The deployment process might involve building the application and configuring environment variables.

# Custom App and Document: 
You can create a custom _app.js file to customize the application's wrapper component, and a custom _document.js file to modify the HTML document structure.
